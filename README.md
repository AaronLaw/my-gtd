mGSD-enhancement
=============
Personally, I use mGSD (formally monkeyGTD) for many years. It's a great and handy tool to organize my life with Getting Things Done methodology. 

As a programmer, I found a way to modify how it works soon, before the days I meet git and github to version control the code. Therefore, the mGSD file here is what I've cleaned up from the one I use daily, beforehand 2014-01-15.

setup
=====
No setup is need. Download the mGSD demo3.html and run it with Firefox. (tiddly-fox plugin is needed to save the change in Firefox.)
